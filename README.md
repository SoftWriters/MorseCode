# Morse Code

By [Joshua Zinkovsky](mailto:joshua.zky@gmail.com)

## Instructions

1. Navigate to [repo](https://github.com/Josh961/MorseCode.git)
2. Clone locally using
   `git clone https://github.com/Josh961/MorseCode.git`
3. Open `MorseCode.sln`
4. Right click the `MorseCode` project -> properties
5. Click debug and enter the path of the input file as an argument - application will not run otherwise
6. `ctrl+f5` to run the application
7. Application should display results and any errors in translating a character

## Troubleshooting

The application was cloned and tested on multiple machines and should work fine. However, if there
are any problems, please see the following points:

1. Application is running on .NET Core 2.2 and user must have the SDK installed
2. If any build errors occur, try rebuilding the entire solution

## Discussion

I used the following technologies: C# and MSTest

The solution is split up into three different projects. 
1. `MorseCode` contains the driver program.
2. `MorseCodeLibrary` contains the `ITranslator` interface to implement future possible methods of translation.
3. `MorseCodeTest` contains the unit test file.

## Requirements

The program accepts a flat file as an input. It reads the file using the proper morse code characters, and outputs their
translation in English.

#### Tests

Run tests within visual studio using shortcut `ctrl+r a`


Morse Code
==========

The Problem
-----------
Morse code is a way to encode messages in a series of long and short sounds or visual signals. During transmission, operators use pauses to split letters and words.

Please write a program which will translate lines of Morse code into readable English text. The program should:

1. Accept a flat file as input.
2. Each new line will contain a string of Morse code. The characters used will be:
	1.	. = dot
	2.	\- = dash
	3.	|| = break
3. Output the English text for each line

Sample Input
------------
-..||---||--.

â€¦.||.||.-..||.-..||---||||.--||---||.-.||.-..||-..

Sample Output
-------------
dog

hello world

The Fine Print
--------------
Please use whatever techniques you feel are applicable to solve the problem. We suggest that you approach this exercise as if this code was part of a larger system. The end result should be representative of your abilities and style.  We prefer that you submit your solution in a language targeting the .NET Framework to help us better evaluate your code.

Please fork this repository. If your solution involves code auto generated by a development tool, please commit it separately from your own work.  When you have completed your solution, please issue a pull request to notify us that you are ready.

Have fun.
