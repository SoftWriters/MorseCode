Morse Code
==========

The Problem
-----------
Morse code is a way to encode messages in a series of long and short sounds or visual signals. During transmission, operators use pauses to split letters and words.

Please write a program which will translate lines of Morse code into readable English text. The program should:

1. Accept a flat file as input.
2. Each new line will contain a string of Morse code. The characters used will be:
	1.	. = dot
	2.	\- = dash
	3.	|| = break
3. Output the English text for each line

Sample Input
------------
-..||---||--.

â€¦.||.||.-..||.-..||---||||.--||---||.-.||.-..||-..

Sample Output
-------------
dog

hello world

Additional Information
---------------------
This exercise is used to help us get a better picture of how you approach and solve for a given problem.  Your submission will be evaluated based on a variety of criteria including, but not limited to, product quality, demonstrated knowledge of system design and coding best practices, completeness, and ease of use from a consumer and engineering teammate perspective.  The completed solution should give us a good picture of your abilities and style, so feel free to use the programming language and tools with which you are most comfortable. 

Prior to submission, please fork this repository.  If your solution includes code auto generated by a development tool, please use an additional commit to clearly separate it from your own work.  When you have completed your solution, please issue a pull request to notify us that you are ready. 

Have fun!
